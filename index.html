        <h2>About the iCub</h2>
        <p>The iCub is a humanoid robot, developed under the RobotCub project. It is a 53 degree-of-freedom robot, roughly 1m tall, and is equipped with visual, vestibular, auditory, haptic, proprioceptive, and torque sensors.</p>
            <p> Each arm has 16 degrees of freedom, with 9 of these located in the hands.  The palms and fingertips of each arm contain 108 capacitative tactile sensors on a triangular array.  6-axial force/torque sensors are located in the upper arms.</p>

               <p> The legs and torso contain 15 degrees of freedom (3 at the waist), and have 6-axial force/torque sensors located in the thigh.</p>

               <p>The head contains 6 degrees of freedom split between the neck and eyes.  It contains 2 Dragonfly2 cameras (640*480, 15fps), 2 microphones and pinnae, gyros, digital compass and accelerometers. The head is also capable of displaying facial expressions with mechanised eyelids and LED displays for mouth and eyebrow positions.</p>

               <p>Low level control is provided on board by a PC104 card with dual Intel Core 2 Duo 2.16MHz processors. Data transfer to/from the robot is via a Gbit/s Ethernet port.</p>


        <h2>Previous iCub Research</h2>
        <p>The iCub was successfully used within the <a href="http://www.im-clever.eu/">IM-CLeVeR</a> project to investigate developmental learning processes.</p>
        <p>Development in the human infant is restricted by a series of constraints, which restrain the infant's action repertoire and sensing capabilities.  Initially, these constraints reduce the perceived complexity of the environment and limit interaction, providing a scaffold that helps the infant to make sense of the world.  As the infant learns, these constraints are then gradually eased or lifted, allowing the infant to advance into a new stage of development.</p>
        <p>The research investigated these ideas of staged development and led to an efficient robotic learning architecture in which sensorimotor competence grows cumulatively.
