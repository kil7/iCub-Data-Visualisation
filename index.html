        <h2>About this Project</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The iCub is a humanoid robot used for research purposes at Aberystwyth University, namely to investigate the learning process in human infants. It makes use of an algorithm which increases acuity on certain parameters over time, such as resolution of a camera image, to effectively simulate the growth and learning of a child. The iCub robot has potential for some small amounts of movement: 15 degrees of freedom in the legs and torso, 16 degrees of freedom in the arms, and 6 degrees of freedom in the head split between the neck and eyes. This potential for movement allows the iCub to shift its "gaze space", focusing on objects originally outside its field of view.</p>
        <p>The iCub gathers vast amounts of verbose data in the form of feature maps, brightness maps, saturation and hue maps, as well as sensorimotor data detailing the iCub's grip on objects. The principle goal of this project is to visualise this data in novel and interesting ways, attempting to highlight features in the dataset that were previously undiscovered.</p>
               <hr>
        <h2>Previous iCub Research</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The iCub was successfully used within the <a href="http://www.im-clever.eu/">IM-CLeVeR</a> project to investigate developmental learning processes.</p>
        <p>Development in the human infant is restricted by a series of constraints, which restrain the infant's action repertoire and sensing capabilities.  Initially, these constraints reduce the perceived complexity of the environment and limit interaction, providing a scaffold that helps the infant to make sense of the world.  As the infant learns, these constraints are then gradually eased or lifted, allowing the infant to advance into a new stage of development.</p>
        <p>The research investigated these ideas of staged development and led to an efficient robotic learning architecture in which sensorimotor competence grows cumulatively.
